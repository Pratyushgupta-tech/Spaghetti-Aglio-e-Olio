let's start up with the reciepe now  

1. COOK THE SPAGHETTI: Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.

2. SAUTE THE GARLIC: Meanwhile,about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and saute for 3-5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.

3. TOSS THE PASTA IN THE SAUCE: Once the pasta is ready to go use tongs to transfer the pasta immediately to the saute pan, along with 1/2 cup of hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously  until is is evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of starchy pasta water.

4. TASTE AND SEASON: Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if nedded.
